# Language Comparison: OCaml, Scala, and F*

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive comparison of three programming languages: **OCaml**, **Scala**, and **F\***. Each of these languages has unique features, strengths, and use cases. This document outlines the key differences and similarities among them.

## Overview

- **OCaml**: A functional programming language with strong static typing and a rich type inference system. Known for its performance and expressiveness.
- **Scala**: A hybrid language that combines object-oriented and functional programming. It runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and has seamless interoperability with Java.
- **F\***: A language focused on functional programming and dependent types, designed for program verification and formal methods.
